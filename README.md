# Clean My Mac

Shell script to clean macOS using 2 commands (1 if already installed).

Cleaning the OS can improve system **performance**.  With a sizeable amount of data in the system's cache - a lot of which is likely outdated - speed and performance can be impacted.

Another reason to clean the OS is to ensure **privacy**. Generally, caches contain private information. Clearing this information reduces the risk of it getting out if your system is compromised in any context.

The [`clean-my-mac.sh`](clean-my-mac.sh) script clears data such as outdated caches and logs from macOS.

## Setup / Installation
